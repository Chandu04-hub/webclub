    <h1 align="center"><b>NATURE</b></h1>
    <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>
    <H2>WHAT IS NATURE</H2>
    <p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".</p>

    <p>There are natural sciences that study different parts of nature, for example the science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies every type of living thing.</p>
    <h2><b></b>Mother Nature</h2>
    <p>We respect nature as our mother and call it “Mother Nature” because, just like a mother for her child, Mother Nature fulfils our needs and nurtures us like her children. She provides us food to eat, water to relieve our thirst, a place to live, scenes to enjoy, and medicines, and just like a mother, she teaches us important lessons, sometimes even through hard experiences. But above that, we are totally dependent on her existence.</p>
    <h4>Nature provides..</h4>
    <p>Just like a tree depends on the connection of its roots, mankind’s roots are deeply connected to nature. Directly or indirectly, everything that we use and depend upon is provided by nature, which is why we respect it as our mother. Our nature provides us with a variety of beautiful flowers, attractive birds, animals, and green plants; a blue sky, land, running rivers, sea, forests, air, mountains, hills, and much more.</p>
    <h4>Threats to nature</h4>
    <p>Though there are people who, for their own profits, do not hesitate to harm it, they can go to even the lowest of the low, like cutting down trees, destroying lands, and poisoning water sources, just to make a fortune. We need to realise that our selfish and bad activities have disturbed nature to a great extent.</p>
    <h4>Necessity of Conservation</h4>
    <p>Recently, our family went to a neighbouring state. It was beautiful and scenic the last time we visited, but this time it was not the same; the air was polluted and the water was black due to industrial waste. The industries and construction had ruined the place; it used to be a sight to see, but now the pollution won’t even let us see the clear blue sky.</p>
    <h2><i>Things to Learn from Nature</i></h2>
    <p>Nature has a plethora to teach human beings. Here are a few of them:-</p>
    <h4><b>Essential Resources</b></h4>
    <p>Using the healthy food and drink that nature provides, we can live a healthy lifestyle. In a similar way, it gives us food and water so we can function. The two essential components for survival, rainfall and sunshine, are produced by nature.</p>
    <h4><b>Discipline</b></h4>
    <p> Nature also teaches us to appreciate the time and use it wisely because life is short and time is fleeting. Every day, the sun rises. The uninterrupted cycle of nature teaches us the value of discipline and punctuality.</p>
    <h4><b>Patience And Perseverance</b></h4>
    <p>It teaches us to work tirelessly toward our objective while continuing to flow forward like a river. Additionally, it conveys a message of bravery and hope. Even though nature suffers, it continues. With patience, we can continue and are certain to succeed, just as the sun emerges from the darkness of night after the darkest hour.</p>
